# About me
<img src="Profile picture.jpg" width="200"/>


I am Meghna Koushik, a Master of Architecture student. My study and research focuses on Building Performance and Diagnostics and Decarbonization. I believe data vizualizations are extremely powerful tools to convey a story. 

# What I hope to learn
Telling Stories with Data is a wonderful course that covers designing, comprehending and generating data vizualizations. My main takeaways from this course are:

1. How to simplify a large dataset and convey critical stories with minimal data. 
2. Critiquing illustrations
3. Technical knowledge of Tableau and Flourish

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
In Visualizing government debt I explored a dataset from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) called 'General Government Debt'for the year 2019. I analysed the the data in three parts:

Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

Part 2: Working with Flourish

Part 3: Working with Tableau

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
In critique by design, I picked a visualization, understood the story it wanted to convey, identified flaws, and re-created the visualization to communicate the story better. The visualization I chose was from a financial education website called howmuch.net. The data set is from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on income taxes and incomes worldwide. I used Stephen Few's Data Visualization to critique it, made wireframe sketches and re-created the visualizations on Tableau. 

## Final project
