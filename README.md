# About me
<img src="Profile picture.jpg" width="200"/>


I am Meghna Koushik, a Master of Architecture student. My study and research focuses on Building Performance and Diagnostics and Decarbonization. I believe data vizualizations are extremely powerful tools to convey a story. 

# What I hope to learn
Telling Stories with Data is a wonderful course that covers designing, comprehending and generating data vizualizations. My main takeaways from this course are:

1. How to simplify a large dataset and convey critical stories with minimal data. 
2. Critiquing illustrations
3. Technical knowledge of Tableau and Flourish

Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

Part 2: Working with Flourish

Part 3: Working with Tableau
