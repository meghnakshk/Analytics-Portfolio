# Outline
Buildings account for 40% of the United States's carbon emissions, and appliances are the major contributors to carbon emissions in buildings. Refrigerators, specifically, are of great concern since they are connected to electric power 24 hours a day, year-round. Several households in the United States need to update their primary and secondary refrigerators that consume significant energy. Through a range of visualizations, this project shows the number of old refrigerators in the United States, their energy consumption and the need to update them. This story urges readers to surrender and replace their old refrigerators with energy-plus refrigerators and directs them to rebate programs proposed by the government.

The main idea that the story wants to convey is that old refrigerators consume significant amounts of energy in the United States, and by the end of the presentation I urge people to discard/ replace their old refrigerators.

The sketches start broad, with the consumption of energy in buildings. The second and the third sketch shows the percentage of energy consumption by appliances in buildings and by refrigerators respectively. The fourth sketch shows the number of 20+ year old refrigerators in the country used as primary refrigerating, secondaary refrigrating and freezzing devices in the United States. The next of drawings are infograms that convey the amount of energy consumed by one refrigerator, by all the 20+ year old refrierators, and their respective carbon emissions. The next couple of drawings show how the old refrigerators are distributed and urges the audience to exchange their refrigerators and provides links to the government rebate finder and energy star refrigerator portfolio.

# The data
The data source for this project is going to be U.S Energy Information Agency's survey called "Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) 2020". This dataset is available on EIA's website. Additionally I will be using Energy Star's savings calculator, LLNL's enerrgy flows diagram (2020) and, U.S Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S EPA) Greenhousegas Equivalencies calcultor to get some information on energy usage, and carbon emissions. These are publicly available datasets. A link to these datasets are listen in the table below.

# Method and medium
From the EIA dataset, I will clean the data for rewuired information on refrigerators and visualize it using Tableau and Flourish. I plan on using Abobe illustrator, to make text and infofram diagrams. I plan to use shorthand to put the entire presentation together and publish it.
