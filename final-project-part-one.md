# Outline
Buildings account for 40% of the United States's carbon emissions, and appliances are the major contributors to carbon emissions in buildings. Refrigerators, specifically, are of great concern since they are connected to electric power 24 hours a day, year-round. Several households in the United States need to update their primary and secondary refrigerators that consume significant energy. Through a range of visualizations, this project shows the number of old refrigerators in the United States, their energy consumption and the need to update them. This story urges readers to surrender and replace their old refrigerators with energy-plus refrigerators and directs them to rebate programs proposed by the government.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

# The data
The data source for this project is going to be U.S Energy Information Agency's survey called "Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) 2020". This dataset is available on EIA's website. Additionally I will be using Energy Star's savings calculator, LLNL's enerrgy flows diagram (2020) and, U.S Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S EPA) Greenhousegas Equivalencies calcultor to get some information on energy usage, and carbon emissions. These are publicly available datasets. A link to these datasets are listen in the table below.

# Method and medium
From the EIA dataset, I will clean the data for rewuired information on refrigerators and visualize it using Tableau and Flourish. I plan on using Abobe illustrator, to make text and infofram diagrams. I plan to use shorthand to put the entire presentation together and publish it.
