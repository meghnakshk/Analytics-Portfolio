# Wireframes and Storyboards

The structure for the presentation retains elements from the sketches presented in Part 1 of this project. The project begins with explaining why it is essential to care about building energy consumption; the focus of this project - residential buildings and the contribution of major appliances in a house to its energy consumption. The storyboard then explains why refrigerators are in detail, the story behind inefficient refrigerators and how replacing it will be beneficial. It links the rebates and the energy star refrigerator portfolio toward the end.

Based on the sketches done in Part 1, I constructed my basic wireframe and storyboard on Shorthand.
