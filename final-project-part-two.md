# Wireframes and Storyboards

The structure for the presentation retains elements from the sketches presented in Part 1 of this project. The project begins with explaining why it is essential to care about building energy consumption; the focus of this project - residential buildings and the contribution of major appliances in a house to its energy consumption. The storyboard then explains why refrigerators are in detail, the story behind inefficient refrigerators and how replacing it will be beneficial. It links the rebates and the energy star refrigerator portfolio toward the end.

Based on the sketches done in Part 1, I constructed my basic wireframe and storyboard on Shorthand.

# User Research and Interviews:

The user research study in this Project aims to understand four main items:
1. The legibility of the proposed story line
2. The effectiveness of the graphics to convey information
3. The persuasiveness of the visualizations 
4. The usefulness of the call to action

### Interview Questions:
1. What is the presentation trying to say?
2. Was it easy to follow the storyline?
3. Are you convinced by the argument?
4. 	Did you find the visualizations useful?
5. 	What didn't work? Did you find anything confusing?
6. 	Any suggestions/ recommendations to improve?
7. 	Was the ending useful?

## Target Audience:

### Homeowners

Homeowners are the main target for this blog post because several of them are unaware of the ineffectiveness of their old refrigerators. Homeowners tend to use their refrigerator for as long as it works without realizing how detrimental it is to the environment and how bad it is for their pockets. Homeowners often read about climate change but usually need to learn how to contribute to the fight against it. This blog post is an effective strategy for them to contribute to saving energy for the climate and cost on their energy bills.

### Government Officials

Low-income households especially suffer from energy insecurity. Families struggle to pay bills. The government has measures for energy insecurity and funding to pay bills for impoverished households under The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). However, the government needs to have measures in place for complete equipment switchouts. Total equipment replacements have a payback of 5 years for refrigerators and are a more effective solution than energy bill assistance programs. This blog post could also be informative for government officials to understand where they could focus on savings.

## Interviewees:

Since the main aim of this project is to educate, I identified different age groups of people to interview. I presented my outline to three women in different age groups to understand if they needed help understanding what I was trying to convey. I got a homeowner(my primary target audience), a professor and a student (rented house) to see if the proposed project is understandable and relevant. The profiles of the three people I interviewed are listed below

## Interview Answers:

 Detailed answers to individual questions by all three interviewees are recorded below.

## Takeaways:

I was glad that all three people found the presentation easy to understand and thought it followed a story even when it was not fully developed. Overall, they felt that the background images were appropriate, the visualizations were mostly easy to comprehend, and the resources at the end were valuable. 

### Some changes for Part 3:
1. *Suggestion to add background images to visualizations:*  When I first presented the preview, I put together the visualizations on a white background which many felt did not go with the rest of the presentation. I added images and thought that it looked better.
3. *Income- Age Refrigerator Visualization:*
-  The visualization towards the end didn't incorporate total numbers of all income groups initially, which people preferred seeing. I added that to show the totals and the number of 20+-year-old refrigerators. 
- The latest suggestion on the visualization was that the number of 20+-year-old refrigerators seems insignificant to the total number of households. The interviewee suggested moving the visualization or changing it not to make it seem inconsequential.
4. *Formatting:* Changing colors of fonts and brightness of the background image to improve visibility and enhance readability
5. Add information about the specific target audience and the solution towards the end. Part of this suggestion has been incorporated but can be improved.

# Moodboards and Persona

The idea I wanted to convey with my theme is "old" and "rusty." I found a color palette with mostly browns, some greys, and black and white. I thought brown might be an exciting color to represent anything I wanted to highlight. The idea is to design a scheme such that all images are greyscaled, and only some rusty parts of the refrigerators are left in color to show emphasis. The pictures towards the end become coloured images showing hope and a definitive path to follow. Some illustrations and ideas for the theme are presented in the form of a mood board below.
