# Changes from Part 2:
**Suggestion to add background images to visualizations: When I first presented the preview, I put together the visualizations on a white background which many felt did not go with the rest of the presentation. I added images and thought that it looked better.**

This suggestion was taken into consideration and similar images were added behind all visualizations to make the presentation look coherant 

**Income- Age Refrigerator Visualization:
The visualization towards the end didnâ€™t incorporate total numbers of all income groups initially, which people preferred seeing. I added that to show the totals and the number of 20+-year-old refrigerators.**



**The latest suggestion on the visualization was that the number of 20+-year-old refrigerators seems insignificant to the total number of households. The interviewee suggested moving the visualization or changing it not to make it seem inconsequential.**

This graph is extremely informative. It might appear inconsquential in comparison to the total U.S propulation, but it is conveying an important message. In order to make it seem less inconsequential I moved it's position and gave an expanation to illustrate how much this actually translates to in terms of data.

**Formatting: Changing colors of fonts and brightness of the background image to improve visibility and enhance readability
Add information about the specific target audience and the solution towards the end. Part of this suggestion has been incorporated but can be improved.**
