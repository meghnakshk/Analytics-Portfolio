# Overall Summary:

### Brief
We’ve been severely underreporting how much buildings contribute to overall energy consumption. Accounting for the inefficiency of electricity generation from non-renewable sources, buildings contribute 40% of all energy used. Even a efficiency measure in buildings could make a huge difference. Appliances, in buildings, particularly, refrigerators are major electricity hoggers because they’re running 24 x 7, all day. But refrigerators are also the easiest to replace amongst all appliances. There are 4.5 million households that have 20+-year-old refrigerators even today and 50% of all refrigerators are in low-income households. Switching out the refrigerator could save us a large amount of energy. The call to action is to urge homeowners to give up refrigerators that are older than 20 years to replace them. I provide resources to rebates, and the energy star portfolio to help users make their decision easily.

### Progress

I identified the project outline in Part 1, and developed some intial brainstorming rough sketches for it. 

In part two, I identified the target audience as Homeowners, and Officials. I chose a suitable color palette and I developed a wireframe of the entire storyline on Shorthand and consulted three people (some from the target audience) and asked them to review it. I also made a note of the the in-class reviews I received and made a list of all the suggestions that I needed to take into consideration for Part 3.

In Part 3, I have addressed all the suggestions I received from Part 2. I also added:

- A graphic towards the end that helps users calculate their cost, energy, and carbon savings for various refrigerators by volume. 
- I added conversion factors for energy and carbon emissions to avoid potentially replacing these refrigerators. These are easier to understand since energy is not an easy metric to comprehend.
- I added Government Officials to the last slide as one of the target audiences. 
- I formatted the slides

# Changes from Part 2 Review:
***Suggestion to add background images to visualizations: When I first presented the preview, I put together the visualizations on a white background which many felt did not go with the rest of the presentation. I added images and thought that it looked better.***

I considered this suggestion and added background images behind all visualizations to make the presentation look coherent.

***Income- Age Refrigerator Visualization:
The visualization towards the end didn’t incorporate total numbers of all income groups initially, which people preferred seeing. I added that to show the totals and the number of 20+-year-old refrigerators.***

The updated graphic has totals of all income groups and e individual numbers and percentages highlighting the number of households with 20+-year-old refrigerators. 

**The latest suggestion on the visualization was that the number of 20+-year-old refrigerators seems insignificant to the total number of households. The interviewee suggested moving the visualization or changing it not to make it seem inconsequential.**

This graph is highly informative. It might appear inconsequential compared to the total U.S. population, but it conveys an important message. To make it seem less insignificant, I moved its position and gave an explanation to illustrate how much this translates to in terms of energy and carbon emissions. 

**Formatting: Changing colors of fonts and brightness of the background image to improve visibility and enhance readability
Add information about the specific target audience and the solution towards the end. Part of this suggestion has been incorporated but can be improved.**

While I finalized my initial color scheme, all other formatting was incomplete. I addressed the formatting comment in the final presentation. All critical text is changed to brown to highlight, and all the other text is black.

#### Visualization: 
I created mostly all visualizations on Tableau, only the refrigerator savings calculator was created on Flourish.
